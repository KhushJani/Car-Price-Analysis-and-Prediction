Cars are one of the transportation that people have. Some people buy cars for daily usage. Some people buy cars because they have good memories from the past. Some even bought a car to complete his collection.
It takes a lot of thought to buy a car, for example, the price. “What’s the right price for a car?” To answer this question, I tried to help by building a model machine learning that predicts the price of a car. 

Data Profiling is summarizing data using descriptive statistics. Creating data profiling aims to have a strong understanding of data to compile framework analysis and visualize data.
The next stage after building a machine learning model (Linear Regression, Decision Tree, Random Forest Regressor, Lasso, and Ridge) is evaluating that model. In this evaluation process, I will look at the Mean Squared Error, Mean Absolute Error, and Root Mean Squared Error values. I will take the smallest RMSE value to decide which one is better.
